# To Build
1. Download packages with `npm install`
2. Compile with `tsc`
3. Serve the project folder with your favorite http server

# To Test
1. Download packages with `npm install`
2. Compile with `tsc`
3. run `npm run test`

`tsc` can be run in watch mode: `tsc --watch`. This is useful if you are quickly making changes. The test script automatically runs in watch mode. This plays fairly well with the compiler in watch mode.
