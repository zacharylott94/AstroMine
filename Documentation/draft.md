# Asteroids

## What is it?

It is a ~~Javascript~~ Typescript implementation of a space mining simulator heavily inspired by the old arcade game [_Asteroids_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)>).

## What problem does it solve?

1. It provides entertainment to the user.
2. It provides me with something to put in my portfolio.

## Is there existing software that solves this problem?

Yes, there are many other games inspired by _Asteroids_ along with many clones. I'm not the first, and I hopefully won't be the last.

## Who is this software for?

Users. Specifically videgame players that want to live out their space mining fantasy in a 2D, vector graphics, [positively curved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-torus#Three-dimensional_torus), universe.

## What technologies were employed in the creation of this software?

I used ~~Javascript~~ Typescript, HTML, and CSS. Everything in this project is implemented "in-house." Using outside libraries was not in the spirit of the project.

## What systems were implemented in this project?

- A physics engine to simulate objects in game.
- Collision detection to decide if events should happen.
- A graphics library based on HTML5 Canvas
- A Scoring system to further "game-ify" the... um... game.
- A Sound system to play back retro-style synth wave sounds.

## What programming paradigms were used in the implementation of this software?

Usually, for a game, Object Oriented Design is well suited for the task. However, I opted for a "functional-first" implementation in order to further my skills in this [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming).
