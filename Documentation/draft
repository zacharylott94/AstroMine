Asteroids
What is it?
It is a Javascript implementation of the classic game "Asteroids"

What problem does it solve?
It provides entertainment to the user
It provides me with something to put in my portfolio

Is there existing software that solves this problem?
Yes, there are implementations of Asteroids. The one I looked at runs in the browser as this one will.

Who is this software for?
Users. Specifically users that want to play Asteroids.

What technologies will be employed in the creation of this software?
I will be using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The current plan is to implement everything myself without using outside libraries.

What systems need to be made for this project?
There will need to be a physics engine to simulate the motion of the game objects
There will need to be a rendering engine to draw game objects
There will need to be event handling/collision detection to enable interactions between game objects
There will need to be a scoring system to determine how well the user plays and to encourage competition.

What programming paradigms will be used in the implementation of this software?
Usually, for a game, object oriented design is well suited for the task. However, I am considering attempting a functional implementation in order to further my skills in this paradigm.

What game objects will exist?
Currently, asteroids, the player ship, and ship projectiles
